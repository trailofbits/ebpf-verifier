The eBPF Verifier Harness project seeks to isolate the eBPF verifier from the
Linux kernel in order to allow efficient verification that an eBPF program will
run on various kernel versions. It will also allow for detecting discrepencies
in the eBPF verifier between differen kernel versions.

runtime.c contains stubbed out/reimplemented functions that verifier.c or a
dependency requires.

main.c runs the actual harness.

.h files include additional stubbed out functions/macros.

The verifier is called using the syscall interface.
