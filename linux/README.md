This is probably the most difficult portion of the harness to understand.

Description of files:
1. and "_kernel_src_files.txt" are backups of the different file names I used for different versions
2. kernel_src_files.txt is the file that lists all objects to be built from linux kernel for harness
3. scripts/clang_cmds.py is a bit of a misnomer, but it basically modifies the kernel generated "compile_commands.json" via some hacky python
4. clang_cmds.sh is generated by the aforementioned script and actually compiles all the static object files from the kernel
5. header_stubs/header_stubs.h is included in every kernel source file. if/def statements within determine which of the other kernel header stubs will be included in that file. This can get tricky since ordering of the header files is important and may need to be different between kernel versions. This was my first approach to generalizing the harness to all kernel versions. It has problems.
6. kernel.a is the end result of linking all the static objects together and it is used by the runtime as a sort of "kernel library"
