Each of these directories store limited artifacts that are generated during compiling the kernel that are necessary to do things. 

Hopefully won't accidentally "make clean" and have to wait for the kernel to recompile.

1. vmlinux --> hopefully enough to allow samples/bpf to run
2. compile_commands.json 
3. copies of the below bitcode files (for clang compiled kernels) 

kernel/bpf/btf.bc
kernel/bpf/tnum.bc
kernel/bpf/disasm.bc
kernel/bpf/core.bc
kernel/bpf/helpers.bc
kernel/bpf/verifier.bc
